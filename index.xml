      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Some content.&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there&#39;s an extra fifteen in there, it&#39;s all yours, you&#39;ve earned it. &lt;a href=&#34;prodihugendavar/&#34;&gt;We made a deal&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That&#39;s right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look... I feel like I&#39;m running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we&#39;re dead. There&#39;s no more room for error. Not with these people. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
